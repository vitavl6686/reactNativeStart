User Navigation
- - - - - - - - 

Buttons in React Native:
1) <Button> is a primitive component. Very basic. 
2) TouchableOpacity is very customisable, can detect
a press on just about any component. 

__
<Button />

*need a prop 'title = String'
*onPress = {function}

___
<TouchableOpacity> </TouchableOpacity>

*Between tags we add any elements we want to be monitored for pressing
* onPress as a prop of TouchableOpacity works in a usual way

___
Idea: we can send props with a custom component.
It's the argument of the lambda function we create when create a component.

when we use StackNavigator, the props.navigation is added to the component function
We can use props.navidation.navigate(screenName) in onPress of buttons.

___
Small addition.

We can use ({navigation}) to access only props.navidation
