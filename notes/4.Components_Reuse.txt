Components Reuse
_____________
Idea:
We can use reusable components with props to configure them. 

Props are created by PARENT component for the CHILD component.
_____________
To reuse component:

1) Import it in a parent component
2) use it in self-closing tags

_____________
To customise a reusable component:

1) add a prop to the parent component (add it to the child's tag 
as usual)

2) use props.prop_name_created_in_parent in child's component

_____________
Detail:
I can use use ({property_Name}) instead of (props)

HOW TO USE IMAGES
* Tag <Image />
* prop source = {require('path')}
* all images are in assets folder
* example: 
    <Image source = {require('../../assets/pictures/beach.jpg')}/>

DYNAMIC REQUIRE() IS NOT SUPPORTED
