Text inputs.
****
 <TextInput />

 1) This tag has no styling applied to it by default. So, it's not visible by default.
 
 2) Important props:
    -- autoCapitalize="none"
    -- autoCorrect={false}
    -- value 
    -- placeHolder
    -- onChangeText
    -- onEndEditing

3) A parent cannot fetch props from its child. 
So,  to work with a text input we need:
    1) set a state in a parent (current value)
    2) give this state as an argument for child's prop value.
    3) give a callback function onChangeText() to a child element that changes the state
    4) in onChangeText argument is a text currently in the input
