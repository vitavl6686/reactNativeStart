1. Lists can be translated into a list of elements
using the primitive element FlatList.

FlatList:
* turns an array into a list of elements.
* props needed:
    * data -- the array of data to create a bunch of elements
    * renderItem -- function that will turn each item of the array into an element

* <FlatList 
    data = {} 
    renderItem = {(x) => {
                        return  <Text>{x}</Text>
                            } 
                } 
/>

_______
If a list contains objects, each object is {item: object, index : i}, so we need to use (x.item) or use ({item})
_______
Why we cannot miss **key** prop? 
- - - - - -- - - - 

That doesn't allow react native to separate elements. When updating the array, react native will delete the whole
list and create it from scratch.

Using **key** property helps link the object to the component and change only one component. 

________
Implementing key property.
- - - - - - - - -
method 1.

1) add key property to the original object
    * unique
    * string
    * consistent

2) add key property to FlatList component itself. 
    *prop keyExtractor = {(friend) => friend.name}
